# Summary of ARC Prize Solution Package

This package provides a comprehensive solution for the ARC Prize contest, which involves solving pattern-based problems using artificial intelligence. The core classes defined in this package include `Cell`, `Grid`, `Pattern`, `Group`, `SuperGroup`, and `Constellation`. Each class represents different levels of abstraction and complexity in the problem space. The `Cell` class represents a single cell in the grid, while the `Grid` class represents the entire grid composed of multiple `Cell` objects. The `Pattern` class abstracts a combination of `Cell` objects, and the `Group` class represents a collection of `Pattern` objects. The `SuperGroup` class is a higher-level abstraction that groups multiple `Group` objects, and the `Constellation` class represents the highest level of abstraction, grouping multiple `SuperGroup` objects.

Each class includes a probability field representing the raw occurrence probability in an unseen problem, and a `properties` member that is a list of methods/functions applicable to the class. The package also provides type casting functions to cast a class to its higher abstraction level and functions to reduce a class to its lowest form. Additionally, the `Grid` class includes validation logic to ensure that each cell position in the grid is unique and correctly populated. This package is designed to facilitate the development of algorithms that can interpret and transform input grids into corresponding output grids based on learned patterns and transformation rules, enabling AI to generalize from a limited number of training examples and apply learned transformations to new, unseen test cases.
