## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive solution for the ARC Prize competition, aiming to advance the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI). The ARC Prize, initiated to stimulate AI research towards AGI, challenges participants to develop algorithms capable of solving pattern-based problems using a limited set of training data. Each problem consists of pairs of input and output grids, where the task is to discern the underlying patterns and transformations that map inputs to corresponding outputs. The ultimate goal is to generalize these transformations to accurately predict outputs for new, unseen inputs.

The core idea behind this project is to leverage both symbolic and neural methods to create a hybrid approach for solving ARC tasks. By combining discrete program search with deep learning-driven intuition, our solution navigates the vast program space more efficiently. This approach mimics human cognitive processes, using symbolic reasoning for step-by-step problem solving while employing neural networks to intuitively prune the search space. Additionally, we utilize techniques such as domain-specific language (DSL) program synthesis and active inference to further enhance our model's ability to generalize from limited training data.

The ARC Prize competition is not just a test of technical prowess but a step towards understanding and replicating human-like intelligence in machines. The competition underscores the importance of skill acquisition and generalization, with a stringent evaluation process to ensure fairness and rigor. By participating in this challenge, our project aims to contribute to the broader AI research community, pushing the boundaries of what AI systems can achieve and bringing us closer to the realization of true AGI.

## Must DO:

You must comment the section of the code in the Pydantic BaseModel class in the crate_model class. Refer to this issue for more details: https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/discussions/5782. Hopefully, this will be fixed in a future version of Pydantic.
    
    if __base__ is not None:
        if __config__ is not None:
            pass
            # raise PydanticUserError(
            #     'to avoid confusion `__config__` and `__base__` cannot be used together',
            #     code='create-model-config-base',
            # )
        if not isinstance(__base__, tuple):
            __base__ = (__base__,)
