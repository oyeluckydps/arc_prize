var WORKING_FOLDER = "./integrated/"

The WORKING_FILE define the file@function that the agent should work on.
The WORKING_FOLDER defines the folder that the agent should work on.

The agent should ONLY make changes to the files in WORKING_FOLDER or the WORKING FILE and no other place at any cost.

# 1 - INSTRUCTION FOR AGENT

1. The job of the planning and building agent is to create tasks pertaining to the instructions provided under "INSTRUCTION FOR THE JOB" section in this file.
2. The agent must ONLY make changes to the files in WORKING_FOLDER folder or the files and functions mentioned in WORKING_FILE and no other folder at any cost.
3. Always use the best of practices in python for writing the code. Ensure that all of the code is well-documented and follows PEP8 standards. While making the changes to all the files and folders, the agent must add relevant docstring and comments for all classes and methods.
4. Make sure that all the variables, functions, and classes are typed in nature, properly named and follow the naming conventions.
5. Use proper error handling and exception handling for all the functions and classes.
6. After completing the tasks, go through the section 3 i.e CONCLUDING INSTRUCTIONS and make the changes mentioned there.

# 2 - INSTRUCTION FOR THE JOB

1. I want you to read the decomposer and its associated files and functions. Then I want you to read the challenge description files. Go through the explanation field of the sample obects created in these files as they will be helpful in writing the code.
2. Write code in the WORKING_FOLDER/direct_ask.py file that will take a challenge desctiption sample object and pass it to LLM agent composed through DSPy library.
3. Load a challenge set using the following code:
    working_set = 'train'
    grids_type = 'input'
    page_number = 4
    grids = load_json_by_page(folder=Path('processed_json/evaluation_challenges/'), page_number=page_number)
4. Then form a list of input output pairs using the custom_types.input_output_pair.InputOutputPair class. Call this training set.
5. Next extract one input matrix from the test set and save it as test matrix.
6. Write a dspy.signature based class with the following fields:
    ChallengeDescription, INput Type --> Give the challenge description sample object here.
    Training Set --> Give the training set here.
    Test input matrix --> Give the test input matrix here.
    Query --> Write a prompt query for the LLM agent to generate the output matrix corresponding to the test input matrix. Ask the LLM to go through the Challenge Description, then go through the input output pairs of the training set. It should try to understand the causation that leads from teh input matrix to the output matrix. It should also get a grisp on the frequency occuring patterns as that would help it to generate the output matrix.
    Output matrix --> output type --> The otuput matrix to be generated by the LLM agent agent.
7. Finally, write a code to display the output matrix using the GUI.matplotlib.create_grid_image.create_grid_image function.

# 3 - CONCLUDING INSTRUCTIONS

1. Add comment whereever required. Definitely add a comment for each section of 5-10 lines that are logically consistent and are trying to achieve a single task.
2. update the summary of changes made in the WORKING_FOLDER/SUMMARY.md file. Keep the original summary and just add the changes made by agent at the end of the file after puting ================================================================================ at the beginning of the new section.
