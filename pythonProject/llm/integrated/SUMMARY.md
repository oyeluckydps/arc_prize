# Summary of Changes

- Created an empty `__init__.py` file in the `integrated` folder.
- Added code in `integrated/direct_ask.py` to take a challenge description sample object and pass it to the LLM agent composed through the DSPy library.
- Loaded a challenge set and formed a list of input-output pairs.
- Extracted one input matrix from the test set and saved it as the test matrix.
- Defined a `dspy.signature` based class with the specified fields.
- Displayed the output matrix using the `GUI.matplotlib.create_grid_image.create_grid_image` function.
